# Java Adventure Game
This is a Java Adventure Game developed my Cecil Cao.
It is planned to be a 2D Adventure game, derived from a YouTube tutorial authored by [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&amp;ab_channel=RyiSnow)
Most of the basic components that will be used will be derived from this tutorial. There may be other references as time goes on.
Currently, the project is far from complete and will require time before it can be used.


## Support
I will not be active on GitHub 24/7, so it will be best to contact me via email at: cecil.cao@mail.utoronto.ca for any issues


## Roadmap
Currently, the game will be developed following [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&amp;ab_channel=RyiSnow)'s 2D adventure game tutorial,
where I will be learning how to develop games using Java using Swing.
Once everything is set up and I am able to start branching off from the tutorial, I plan to make a Fire Emblem inspired RPG.


## Contributing
I am not currently looking for anyone to help contribute to this game, please do not send pull requests.
If there is an issue with the code, however, I will be happy if you open an issue for any bugs or crashes.
Later in the future, this may change when I begin working towards making the game unique to me.


## Authors and Acknowledgement
Code and assets created and written by Cecil Cao.
I will have to thank the YouTuber RyiSnow for his comprehensive tutorials, helping me learn how to develop a game in Java.
None of this would be possible without it.


# Devlog
## [Patch 0.0.02] - 2022-01-28
Pictures! A video game needs to have some sort of graphics! I added some hand-made assets onto the project and set up a
tile mapping algorithm to make level development a bit easier! More to come with bigger and better maps!
### Added
- Assets for the player, and three types of tiles (water, grass, wall)
- Create a tile mapping algorithm to draw the background

## [Patch 0.0.01] - 2022-01-27

### Added
- Set up the workspace for this project.
- Created a basic game engine and window using Swing. (Currently a variable step game engine)
- Basic WASD controls set up for the game.

## Project Status
Still in the early development phase. The project is still insubstantial will require time to get to a sufficient level.
